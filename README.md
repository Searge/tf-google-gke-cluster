# tf-google-gke-cluster

This repository contains Terraform code for creating a GKE cluster on Google Cloud Platform.

## Usage

1. Create a new bucket in Google Cloud Storage to store your Terraform state.
2. Update the `backend` configuration in `main.tf` to use your bucket name.
3. Define the required variables in `variables.tf`.
4. Set the values for the variables in `vars.tfvars`.
5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
6. Run `terraform fmt` to format the Terraform code.
7. Run `terraform validate` to check the syntax and configuration of the Terraform files.
8. Run `terraform plan` to generate an infrastructure plan.
9. Run `infracost` to estimate the cost of changes to your infrastructure.
10. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your cloud infrastructure.
11. After applying the changes, run `terraform show` to view the status of the infrastructure.
12. To delete the infrastructure, run `terraform destroy`.
13. Make sure to properly control and monitor access to your Terraform state to ensure the security and reliability of your infrastructure.
